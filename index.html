				<p>I am a 21-year-old journalist from Dallas, Texas. Growing up in a city full of diverse people
  and ever changing culture, led to my passion of exploring people's stories.I am currently a senior at the University of Missouri studying journalism with an emphasis in
    magazine publishing. I am also minoring in political science and have a passion for politics</p>
<p>Although I dream to create my own magazine one day, I have many skills in news reporting, magazine writing and social media managing. I am currently looking for a job, so please me if you are interested in my experience as a journalist. I have written for many publication, such as Missouri Digital News, The Columbia Missourian, D Magazine and Vox Magazine. I am a eager journalist willing in the work and ready for my next adventure.</p>

				<h2>Here is an example of a story I wrote for a class. </h2>
        <p>A panel of professors, filmmakers, and journalists gathered to discuss race and share their experiences about reporting on race.
Katherine Reed, an Associate Professor at the MU School of Journalism, started the panel Based off a True Story by sharing a headline from the Missourian over fifty-years ago about racial relations on MUâ€™s campus. In November, during the Concerned Student 1950 protest, there was a very similar headline.</p>
<p>Many outside sources state the key to ending racism is listening to each and trying to understand one another. However, panelist Marco Williams, a director and professor at New York University, said that there is more to it than just listening. Williams argued we must do something with the information after listening to other stories and learn to appreciate who one is as individual in a certain race.</p>
<p>Williams also said that part of the problem with trying to end racism is people are trying to understand a race, rather than empathize. Panelist Stephanie Shonekan, a Department Chair for Black Studies at MU, gave an analogy about empathizing rather than understanding. </p>
<p>Shonekan asked how many suffered from sunburn, something that is more common for Caucasians than minorities.  Shonekan added that just because she did not understand it personally and feel the pain of sunburn does not mean that she could deny that sunburn exists or that it hurts those it affects.</p>
